Pixel data from the EPIC imager is ingested into a postgres database for further analysis.  For each source, a 5x5 grid is centered on the source and values for each frequency and all four cross-polarizations are extracted. The Spectrogram application provides a simple interface to query the DB for visualization and download. Data can be viewed as soon as it is extracted using the live spectrogram feature.

## Steps
1. Select the station for which you want to explore the data. Only data from the Sevilleta station is available for now but data from the Owens Valley will be available soon.
2. Select the desired object from the list of sources. A few sources like the sun are continuously monitored while most of them will be monitored for a short period. 
3. Select the observation session. Although the EPIC imager is run continuously, there can be gaps between the data either due to health checks or other unspecified frequency changes. The available sessions can be requested within a window of up to 24hrs.
4. The spectrograms for a period of up to 120s at a time can then be fetched from the selected session.
