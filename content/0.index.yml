  description: Leveraging the E-field Parallel Imaging Correlator (EPIC) algorithm, we build and use real-time imaging tools to detect and analyse transient phoenomena in the low-frequency radio sky. Live stream 25 FPS multi-frequency all-sky views from the Long Wavelength Array in Sevilleta, New Mexico. Explore and download the spectrograms of radio transients.
